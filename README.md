🏦 **BankBot: Next-Gen Conversational Banking Ecosystem**

BankBot is a full-stack, AI-powered banking platform that bridges the gap between complex Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and secure financial operations. Designed to replace rigid, menu-based bots, BankBot allows users to manage their finances through intuitive, human-like conversation.

🌟 **Project Vision**

Most banking bots struggle with varied phrasing or fail to securely link AI intent to database actions. BankBot solves this by using a custom-trained NLU engine that extracts structured financial data from raw text, validates it through a multi-layer security protocol, and commits it to an atomic relational database.

🚀 **Key Features**

Intelligence: A proprietary NLU Engine with Intent Recognition and Entity Extraction (converting "Send 500 to my brother" into a structured transaction).

Security: Integrated authentication with secondary password challenges for sensitive actions like transfers or balance checks.

Hybrid AI: A dual-mode system that switches between Transaction Mode (banking tasks) and Knowledge Mode (educational queries using a vast financial knowledge base).

Governance: A comprehensive Admin Control Center providing real-time system monitoring, query audit logs, and a "no-code" environment for model retraining.

UI/UX: A modern, "Glassmorphic" dashboard designed for high-end financial transparency and ease of use.

🛠️ **Technical Stack**

Frontend: Streamlit / Custom CSS (Glassmorphism UI)

Backend: Python

AI/NLU: Custom NLP pipelines for Intent Classification & Entity Parsing

Database: SQLite (Atomic Transactions)

Management: Admin Dashboard for Data Intelligence
